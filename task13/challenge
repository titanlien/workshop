Write a web application that allows users to take a long URL and convert it to a shortened URL similar to https://goo.gl/. 

The program should have a form that accepts the long URL. 
The program should generate a short local URL like /abc1234 and store the short URL and the long URL together in a persistent data store. 
The program should redirect visitors to the long URL when the short URL is visited. 
The program should track the number of times the short URL is visited. 
The program should have a statistics page for the short URL, such as /abc1234/stats. 
Visiting this URL should show the short URL, the long URL, and the number of times the short URL was accessed.

Constraints 
This app must use a persistent data store that others can use. That means a local, in-memory system isn’t appropriate.
Don’t allow an invalid URL to be entered into the form.

Challenges
Detect duplicate URLs. Don’t create a new short URL if one already exists.
Record the date and time each short URL was accessed, and use a graphing library to graph the requests.
